                In 1642, English philospher Thomas Hobbes published De Cive. This document title translates to "On the Citizen" in reference to Hobbes' defense of citizen rights within the United States. He argues that humans are naturally flawed, and these flaws should be reflected within the social contract of the country. By creating this contract, the sovereign establishes order among citizens, and ensures individual peace and security.
