               In 1642, English philospher Thomas Hobbes published De Cive. This document title translates
               to "On the Citizen" in reference to Hobbes' defense of citizen rights within the United
               States. He argues that humans are naturally flawed, and these flaws should be reflected
               within the social contract of the country. By creating this contract, the sovereign
               establishes order among citizens, and ensures individual peace and security.
